# Ecobike

Ecobike is an app that helps you find the closest bike station to you in real time [^1]

Some of the cool stuffs the app can do are:

* Shows bikes in a station.
* Shows slots in a station. 
* Drops a pin in the location of the station.


[^1]: Due to problems with an [API](https://www.ecobici.cdmx.gob.mx/sites/default/files/pdf/manual_api_opendata_esp_final.pdf), the data shown in this app is hardcoded in a json file.
